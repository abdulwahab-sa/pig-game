This is a Vanilla Javascript game called Dice roll and Pig game as well. 
Quoting Wikipedia; "Pig is a simple dice game first described in print in John Scarne in 1945. Players take turns to roll a single die as many times as they wish, adding all roll results to a running total, but losing their gained score for the turn if they roll a 1."
